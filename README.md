# 📖 new tab

![scrn](./src/images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

new tab is a simple, clean new tab page that i made with tailwind css in 2 days out of boredom

## ⏬ installation

Create a file named 'data.json' inside /src/ and make a variable called "apiKey" with the value of your API Key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org)


Download the repository code (<strong>and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) if you want to make changes to the styling</strong>), using a server like [APACHE](https://httpd.apache.org/) to run a local server then redirect the new tab page url to the server url using a browser extension.
